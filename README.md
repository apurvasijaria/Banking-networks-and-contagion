Contains practice codes for Paper1

-links between nodes reflect credit or equity relationships and netwrok is directed
 newnetwork: - test data to test the working of the code; change the first line to link to other codes.
 entrpy :- entropy is the function of probabilty distribution and is a measure ofthe predeictibilty of exposures.
                implemented maximum entropy pordecure using the algorithm provided by Mohammad Djafari(1991) 
                [http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0111126.pdf]
                using the above paper; following codes were extracted-
                fin1_x.m;    fin3_x.m;  me_dens1.m;
                me_dens2.m;  me_dens3.m; ME3.m;  ME2.m; ME1.m
                running ME1.m ME2.m and ME3.m calls other functions.

Connections b/w banks- To obtain the maximum entropy
distribution for the number of links that a bank has against other banks, using
the results of Bianconi (2009) that for uncorrelated networks, the maximum entropy
distribution for the number of links is a Poisson distribution. Uncorrelated
networks are those where the degrees of nodes are not correlated
